# RedOps-AI 🔴🤖  
**AI-Driven Offensive Security & Adversary Emulation Framework**

---

## 📌 Description

**RedOps-AI** is an AI-powered offensive security framework designed to simulate real-world adversarial behavior, automate red team operations, and assist security professionals in identifying vulnerabilities through intelligent attack emulation.

The project bridges **red teaming**, **penetration testing**, and **artificial intelligence** to create adaptive, decision-driven attack workflows that mirror modern threat actors.

> ⚠️ **Disclaimer:**  
> This project is intended strictly for **educational, research, and authorized security testing purposes only**.

## ⚙️ Setup & Installation

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.10+  
- Linux environment (recommended)  
- Virtual environment support  

### Installation

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/RedOps-AI.git
cd RedOps-AI
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt

## 🧠 AI Implementation

RedOps-AI leverages AI/ML concepts to enhance offensive operations:

- **Reinforcement Learning** for attack path optimization  
- **Heuristic-based decision engines** for technique selection  
- **Context-aware execution** based on target response  
- **Adaptive behavior modeling** to mimic real attackers  

AI is used **to assist**, not blindly automate, enabling controlled and explainable offensive testing.
